# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe Game – Project Synopsis

Overview:
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take alternating turns to mark an empty square with their respective symbol—X or O—in an effort to be the first to place three of their marks in a row. This row can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.

Game Rules:
- Two players take turns.
- A move consists of marking an empty cell.
- The first player to align three symbols in a straight line wins.
- If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

Features of Digital Version:
- Interactive GUI using Tkinter.
- Real-time status updates (whose turn it is).
- Automatic win/draw detection.
- Reset functionality to play again without restarting the program.

Applications:
While simple in design, the game helps demonstrate fundamental concepts in programming such as:
- Event-driven logic
- GUI development
- Conditional flow and game state tracking

This project also serves as an introductory example for beginner programmers learning Python and graphical interfaces.
